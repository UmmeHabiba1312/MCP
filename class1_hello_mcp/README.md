# MCP (Model Context Protocol)
It's a way to send your context (like data, instructions, API details, or tool access) to a Large Language Model (LLM) through a standardized protocol.

### In simple words:

* You prepare your message + relevant data in a specific structured format

* Send it to the LLM

* The LLM uses that context to generate a more accurate and relevant response

This ensures the model only gets controlled, relevant, and secure information, improving accuracy and reducing unnecessary processing.
