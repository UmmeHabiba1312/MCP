# MCP (Model Context Protocol)
It's a way to send your context (like data, instructions, API details, or tool access) to a Large Language Model (LLM) through a standardized protocol.

### In simple words:

* You prepare your message + relevant data in a specific structured format

* Send it to the LLM

* The LLM uses that context to generate a more accurate and relevant response

This ensures the model only gets controlled, relevant, and secure information, improving accuracy and reducing unnecessary processing.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): 
A reliable protocol that ensures data arrives complete, in order, and without errors but it's slower because of extra checks.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol): 
A fast, lightweight protocol that sends data without guarantees of delivery or order less reliable but much quicker.

### QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections):
A modern protocol built on UDP that adds reliability, security, and speed combining the best of TCP and UDP.

### Persistence  
keeping the same connection open for many requests instead of closing and reopening it every time.
In HTTP:

- HTTP/1.0 (old) â†’ Non-persistent by default (new connection for every file).
- HTTP/1.1 â†’ Persistent by default (one connection can handle many files).
- HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 â†’ Always persistent, plus they can even send multiple requests at the same time (multiplexing).

# ðŸ”„ Connection Management (Does it stay open?)
When you visit a website, your browser (the client) talks to the web server using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
But HTTP doesnâ€™t actually send the data itself it relies on transport protocols (like TCP or UDP) to move the data across the network.

### ðŸ”¹ HTTP/1.1

- Uses TCP connections.
- With persistent connections (via keep-alive), the browser can reuse the same connection to request multiple files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
- Problem: It processes one request at a time per connection.
- If your page has 50 files, it either opens multiple connections (costly) or handles them sequentially â†’ slow.
- Issue: Head-of-line blocking â†’ If one request is slow, the others behind it get stuck.

### ðŸ”¹ HTTP/2

- Still uses TCP, but introduces multiplexing:
- Multiple requests and responses can be sent simultaneously over the same connection.
- Example: Instead of waiting for file A before requesting file B, it can request both at the same time.
- Uses binary framing, which structures data more efficiently.
- Faster than HTTP/1.1, but still has TCPâ€™s limitation:
-If a single packet is lost in TCP, everything waits (head-of-line blocking at the transport level).


### ðŸ”¹ HTTP/3 (based on QUIC)
- Built on UDP instead of TCP.
- QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a protocol developed by Google that adds reliability, security, and multiplexing on top of UDP.
- Benefits:

    - Avoids TCPâ€™s head-of-line blocking â†’ if one packet is lost, others can still flow.

    - Faster setup: QUIC integrates TLS (encryption), so secure connections are established in fewer steps.

    - More resilient on unstable networks (like mobile data) because it handles connection migration (e.g., if your Wi-Fi switches to 4G, the connection doesnâ€™t break).

Best for streaming, video calls, gaming, and modern web apps.


## Summary
Communication between two computers happens using HTTP, but HTTP doesnâ€™t actually move the data it relies on transport protocols like TCP and UDP.

- TCP: Reliable but slower. Data goes in packets, and if one packet is delayed or corrupted, the others wait (head-of-line blocking). TCP will re-send lost packets, so data isnâ€™t lost, but the user experiences delays. This is what HTTP/1.1 uses.

- HTTP/2: Still uses TCP, but allows multiplexing, meaning multiple requests/responses can happen at once over the same connection â€” faster than HTTP/1.1.

- UDP: Much faster, but not safe. If one packet is lost or corrupted, itâ€™s gone no waiting, no re-sending.

- QUIC (used in HTTP/3): Built on UDP but adds TCP-like reliability and TLS security. Itâ€™s both fast and safe, making it the modern standard.

## Common HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning                               |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| 200  | OK â€“ Success                          |
| 201  | Created â€“ New resource made           |
| 400  | Bad Request â€“ You sent something wrong|
| 401  | Unauthorized â€“ You need to log in     |
| 403  | Forbidden â€“ You canâ€™t access this     |
| 404  | Not Found â€“ Page doesnâ€™t exist        |
| 500  | Server Error â€“ Something broke on the server |
